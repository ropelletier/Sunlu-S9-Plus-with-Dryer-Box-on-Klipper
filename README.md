# SUNLU S9 PLUS WITH DRYBOX CONFIGURATION FILE
#################################################
# This file contains pin mappings for the SUNLU S9 Plus including the Drybox, 
# This printer uses an AVR atmega2560 16MHz chip and is a Ramps v1.0 board.  
# To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the AVR atmega2560. 
# You can flash it over USB. Using kiauh: regular flashing method, make flash (default), USB

This is still a work in progress but I wanted to get the printer.cfg file up here so people can have access to it.
